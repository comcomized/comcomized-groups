| $n, mapped to a point on a vertical line, is a comcomized node-id:
|  when of a human user, it is a negative -wp_p_users->id, 
|  when of a comcom. it is a positive integer id of the (bp) group and 
|  when it is used in asset of an ordinary owner,
|	 it is followed with .percentage of her/his possession  
|      in the asset, otherwise it belongs to a peer owner.
|
| <----------------------a=($n,,,)---”a” is a bp group id
|                          |     |
| $holding_and_holders==($n,($n,,,),,)/br(,$n,,,)/br(,$n,,,)/br(,$n,,,)
|                            | 
| <--------------------------b<--- “b” is a human user id (negative $n)
|
| $holding_and_holders==[
| (key)id =>,         // id of the holder $n 
|     heldby =>,     // list of id of its children holders
|     holding=>]     // null when is tree used for validating joining or a list of pairs of (id of of the holding parent, id of its tree). 
|
| $holding_and_holders of the site, or of any specific holder in the site, can be mapped to one string of 
| concatenation of assets in different line, where each asset is a parent 
| from different tree and is marked by brackets, within which each of 
| the $n items, separated by comma, is of a child owner of the asset and
| as the asset optionally equals its $n. 
|	Such string can be then used for mapping the hierarchies for 
| traversing between the nodes, where all matches of $n in the string 
| (notified to the node after modification) can be stored in the 
| $n_offsets of the node.
| 	In each act of joining for all $n of the smaller in the bigger, the
| $holding_and_holders, in it is most processed form (until all $n are
| negative), is to be checked for being not-matched on the same line. 

Log-page-types in form ?offer->!ok->..update in the 3 tables key-type, comcom , user  [created in creation of comcom]:
        Transactions (?=>sell/buy->ok-> update ?c v,neV steepnes , iiaom reputation etc),
        Group-activity, like grops , the members are children-owners
        Bord=discussion/discussion, like forum

todo:
instead v - newV to have x-newV where x is average v in x time (day, month etc) 
use bp-custom.php
define it by 3 type of events:
1. joining/creating/logs, when  andby whom the fields are changeable
2. table, feeds and interactions, 
3. notification
4. iiaom+webrtc, reputation per contact
